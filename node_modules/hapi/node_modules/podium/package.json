  "readme": "#podium\n\nNode (semi) compatible event emitter with extra features.\n\n**podium** is an event emitter with support for tags, filters, channels, event update cloning,\narguments spreading, and other features useful when building large scale applications. While node's\nnative [`EventEmitter`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter)\nis strictly focused on maximum performance, it lacks many features that do not belong in the core\nimplementation. **podium** is not restricted by node's performance requirement as it is designed for\napplication layer needs where it's overhead is largely insignificant as implementing these features\nwill have similar cost on top of the native emitter.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hapijs/podium.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/hapijs/podium)\n\nLead Maintainer - [Eran Hammer](https://github.com/hueniverse)\n\n## API\n\nThe full API is available in the [API documentation](https://github.com/hapijs/podium/blob/master/API.md).\n\n",
